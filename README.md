# Duplicate Image Search 2
Search your PC for images that look similar.

This is an [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/tutorial-prerequisites) app, meaning it is slightly faster than [the version that works entirely in your browerser](https://github.com/joetache4/Duplicate-Image-Search).

- faster searching and thumbnail generation
- crtl-click to show an image's location in the file browser
- does not ask for confirmation to search a folder

## Useage
Click `run.bat` or run `npm start`.

## Dependencies
- `Node.js`
- `Electron`
- `sharp`
